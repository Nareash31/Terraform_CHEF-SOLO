  In order to flag invalid notifications more quickly
  As a developer
  I want to identify notifications that have an invalid timing type

  Scenario Outline: Notification timings
    Given a cookbook recipe with a resource that <type> <notification_timing>
    When I check the cookbook specifying <version> as the Chef version
    Then the invalid notification timing warning 032 <display> be displayed
  Examples:

    | notifies   |                     | 12.6.0  | should not  |
    | notifies   | before              | 12.6.0  | should not  |
    | notifies   | immediately         | 12.6.0  | should not  |
    | notifies   | immediate           | 12.6.0  | should not  |
    | notifies   | delayed             | 12.6.0  | should not  |
